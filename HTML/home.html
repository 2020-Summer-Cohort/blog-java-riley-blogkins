        <h1>My First Rant</h1>
        <h2>a rant by Riley...</h2>
        <p>
          My first blog. Not sure what to say or talk about…. But here we go! I
          am about halfway through the We Can Code IT bootcamp and I’m having
          some fun! I feel like it is deff a challenge for me. I have been in
          school for a while. I am really liking the CSS and front-end stuff.
          Not sure if that is what I should be focusing on though. I am enjoying
          the change and learning and I hope my blog is okay!!

        <h1>Hot Chicken Takeover Review</h1>
        <h2>Let's Talk Chicken!</h2>
        <p>
          I don't come to Columbus often and was only here for the weekend but
          I'm so glad my friends chose this place to have brunch. I tried the
          chicken sandwich and the reason it's called "hot" chicken takeover is
          because you can choose your heat level. I tried the hot which is 3 out
          4 on the heat scale. I don't usually get spicy as restaurants claim
          it's hot when it's usually not but holy cow! I took two bites and my
          mouth was on fire. Of course, I like to suffer a little bit when I ask
          for spicy so it was perfect. But beware if you're not a spicy fan.
          Even the cold is really flavorful but has a little kick.

            <h2>Salon Review</h2>
            <h3><strong>4.20.19</strong></h3>
            <p>
              There are several things I do not like about this salon. First of
              which is the cancellation policy. You have to cancel 72 hours in
              advance or you get charged a premium. I personally think that is
              excessive because sometimes things come up and plans change. I
              think a 48 hour policy is much more reasonable. The second thing I
              do not like is the filming/photography policy. According to their
              website the moment you walk in you consent to have photos and
              video taken of you. They can use those images/videos in branding,
              social media posts, and on their websites without you knowing.
              They state on their website: "you also waive any right to inspect
              or approve any photo, video, or audio recording taken by staff at
              any the salon." That just sounds a little sketchy to me and
              invasive. Because of their strict cancellation policy and their
              film and photography policy I will not be returning.
