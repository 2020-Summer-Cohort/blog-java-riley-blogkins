        <h1>My First Rant</h1>
        <h2 class="author">Riley Adkins</h2>
        <p>
          My first blog. Not sure what to say or talk about…. But here we go! I
          am about halfway through the We Can Code IT bootcamp and I’m having
          some fun! I feel like it is deff a challenge for me. I have been in
          school for a while. I am really liking the CSS and front-end stuff.
          Not sure if that is what I should be focusing on though. I am enjoying
          the change and learning and I hope my blog is okay!!

        <h1>Hot Chicken Takeover Review</h1>
        <h2 class="author">Blaise Herritt</h2>
        <p>
          I don't come to Columbus often and was only here for the weekend but
          I'm so glad my friends chose this place to have brunch. I tried the
          chicken sandwich and the reason it's called "hot" chicken takeover is
          because you can choose your heat level. I tried the hot which is 3 out
          4 on the heat scale. I don't usually get spicy as restaurants claim
          it's hot when it's usually not but holy cow! I took two bites and my
          mouth was on fire. Of course, I like to suffer a little bit when I ask
          for spicy so it was perfect. But beware if you're not a spicy fan.
          Even the cold is really flavorful but has a little kick.
